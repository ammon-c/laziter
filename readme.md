# Laziter space game (circa 1986)

This archive contains a primitive DOS-based arcade game that 
I wrote around 1986.  This was back when an IBM PC/AT was 
still considered a hot machine and graphics and sound 
capabilities were nearly non-existant.  

The game is called "Laziter" and is similar to the arcade 
game "Space Invaders", but lacks the laser absorbing 
barriers and bonus flying saucers of that game.  

The object of the game is to destroy all of the invading 
spaceships by blasting them with laser bolts from your 
spaceship.  Each time the invading spaceships are allowed to 
reach the bottom of the screen, you loose one of your ships.  
The game ends when you have no more ships left.  

The controls are simple:

* Press the SPACE key to begin the game, or the ESC
  key to end the game.

* During the game, press the left and right cursor
  keys to move the spaceship and press the spacebar
  to fire the spaceship's laser.

This game still runs okay on most modern PCs.  However, if 
you wish to run the game from inside Windows, you should 
make sure that the DOS prompt or Command prompt window has 
been switched to full-screen mode before running the game.

I hope you find this bit of nostalgia entertaining.
